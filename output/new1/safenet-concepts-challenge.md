# Challenge

A [validator](/safenet/core-components/validator) can challenge the [settlement](/safenet/concepts/settlement) request of a [processor](/safenet/core-components/processor).
In this case, the processor has to provide an [attestation](/safenet/concepts/attestation) to prove the validity of the [transaction](/safenet/safenet-transaction).
If the processor fails to provide the attestation, the settlement process is considered invalid, and the validator can slash the processor's stake to reimburse the [liquidity provider](/safenet/core-components/liquidity-provider).
