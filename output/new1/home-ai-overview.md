## Why Use Safe Smart Accounts for AI agents?

Safe Smart Accounts offer a secure and modular solution for enabling AI agents to interact with the blockchain.
While other options include giving an AI agent a private key, using Multi-Party Computation (MPC), relying on custodial services with an API, or manually sending transactions from a user's wallet, Safe Smart Accounts offer distinct advantages.

## Key Benefits of Safe Smart Accounts for AI agents:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Safe Smart Accounts offer robust security features, making them one of the most secure methods for blockchain interactions.
   Signers retain control of private keys, and signers can be replaced if necessary. Additional security measures, such as spending limits, timelocks, and whitelists, can be easily added to safeguard transactions.  
   *This is especially crucial since many AI agents can be influenced by specific prompts.*
2. **True Self-Custody**: With Safe Smart Accounts, there's no reliance on third-party intermediaries.
   This reduces costs and eliminates single points of failure, aligning with blockchain's core principle of decentralization.
3. **Modular Design**: Safe Smart Accounts provide unmatched modularity. Native and third-party modules extend functionality, allowing you to customize accounts based on your project's needs.
4. **Flexibility**: Multiple signers can propose transactions within a Safe Smart Account.
   This allows your AI agent to propose transactions while maintaining your control over the account, with the option to withdraw funds or intervene at any point.
5. **Multi-Signer Setup**: Some use cases involve multiple AI agents acting as signers on a single Smart Account.
   These agents must reach consensus before a transaction is signed, adding an extra layer of security and decentralization.
