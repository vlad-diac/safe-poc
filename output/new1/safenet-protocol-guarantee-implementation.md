# Guarantee Implementation

A Guarantee Implementation is a smart contract registered with the [guarantee engine](/safenet/protocol/guarantee-engine).
It defines the rules and semantics for applying and validating a [guarantee](/safenet/concepts/guarantee).

These implementations can vary in configuration, such as whether guarantees are turned on or off by default or certain guarantees are required for particular flows.
The flexibility of the guarantee implementation allows Safenet to support a range of use cases and transaction types.
