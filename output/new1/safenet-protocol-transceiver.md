# Transceiver

The Transceiver is a bridge adapter used within Safenet to ensure that the [guarantee engine](/safenet/protocol/guarantee-engine) remains bridge-agnostic.
It enables seamless cross-chain communication, allowing the guarantee engine to interact with multiple blockchains.

Transceivers are registered by the [SafeDAO](/safenet/protocol/safe-dao) within the [guarantee engine](/safenet/protocol/guarantee-engine) to support interoperability across different chains and [guarantee implementations](/safenet/protocol/guarantee-implementation).
