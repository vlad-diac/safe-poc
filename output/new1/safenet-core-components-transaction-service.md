# Transaction Service

The Transaction Service operates across all Safe-supported [chains](/safenet/chains) and indexes Safe Smart Accounts and transactions.
In Safenet, it functions as a **shared mempool**, recording transactions that the [processor](/safenet/core-components/processor) needs to execute.

The Event Service works with the Transaction Service, triggering WebHooks for specific Safe events.
