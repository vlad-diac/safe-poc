Safenet

Why Safenet

## Why Safenet?

Blockchains have the potential to become society's global settlement layer, enabling seamless coordination, transactions, and a more interconnected world. Achieving this vision means moving the world's entire GDP on-chain.

However, several significant challenges need to be addressed:

- **Fragmentation**: Different Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions form isolated ecosystems, and blockchains are not yet fully integrated with traditional financial networks.
- **Latency**: Cross-chain transactions face delays due to bridging mechanisms and varying block times.
- **Complexity**: Security concerns and complicated user experiences hinder mainstream adoption.
- **Interoperability**: Blockchains are not natively compatible with the traditional financial system.

## What is Safenet?

Safenet is not a blockchain or layer 2 nor a bridge.
It's an optimistic, validity-proof transaction processing network anchored on the Ethereum mainnet.
It works on top of any existing or future chains and even connects on-chain and off-chain networks like Visa or centralized exchanges.
It separates transaction fulfillment from settlement, allowing users to interact with any supported blockchain protocol.
It uses [optimistic validity proofs](/safenet/optimistic-validity-proof) to ensure every transaction adheres to a set of security [guarantees](/safenet/concepts/guarantee).

By offloading security and cross-chain bridging responsibilities to a network of processors, validators, and liquidity providers, Safenet eliminates the complexity of cross-chain interactions. Users gain the ability to transact across blockchains with unprecedented speed and security—without needing to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## What does Safenet enable?

Safenet enables users to spend their funds on any supported blockchain without a delay and without traditional bridging.
It ensures that users fully control their assets and the level of transaction protection they desire.

Behind the scenes, Safenet handles the settlement by coordinating funds from the various blockchains where the user holds assets.

For the user, all they experience is a seamless, lightning-fast transaction.
