# Home Safe

The Home Safe refers to a [Safe Smart Account](/home/what-is-safe) on Ethereum Mainnet. It is the central hub for Safenet transactions.
It acts as the [home chain](/safenet/chains) account for managing assets and [guarantees](/safenet/concepts/guarantee), facilitating the proper [settlement](/safenet/concepts/settlement) and validation of cross-chain transactions.
