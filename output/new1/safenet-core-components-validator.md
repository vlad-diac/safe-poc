# Validator

The Validator ensures that the [Processor](/safenet/core-components/processor) correctly [settles](/safenet/concepts/settlement) transactions as per the guarantees signed by the [End User](/safenet/core-components/end-user).
If a settlement is invalid or fraudulent, the Validator can challenge it, initiating a dispute that requires the Processor to [prove](/safenet/concepts/attestation) the transaction's validity.
