# Relayer

The Relayer is the externally owned account (EOA) that serves as the transaction originator for [Safenet transactions](/safenet/safenet-transaction).
It is responsible for fronting the gas costs associated with executing transactions.

The [processor](/safenet/core-components/processor) reimburses the Relayer for these gas fees.
While this document does not cover the exact reimbursement mechanism, it ensures that relayers are compensated for their role in transaction execution.
