Guarantee Engine

# Guarantee engine

The Guarantee Engine is a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet (the [home chain](/safenet/chains)) that is responsible for issuing [guarantees](/safenet/concepts/guarantee) during challenge flows.

It is designed to remain as general as possible, managing a list of [guarantee implementations](/safenet/protocol/guarantee-implementation) that verify the correctness of [settlements](/safenet/concepts/settlement).
The guarantee engine works in tandem with the [Transciever](/safenet/protocol/transceiver) contracts, which act as bridge adapters, ensuring compatibility across different chains.

The [SafeDAO](/safenet/protocol/safe-dao) owns and governs the guarantee engine, making it the central authority for configuring and managing guarantees.
