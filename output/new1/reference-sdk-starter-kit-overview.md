Starter Kit Reference

Overview

# Starter Kit Reference

The [Starter Kit](/sdk/starter-kit) is the starting point for integrating the Safe account in the front-end, as it provides the most simplified way to handle the Safe transaction flow in its different forms:

- User operations
- Multi-signature transactions
- Off-chain and on-chain messages

## Install dependencies

To add the Starter Kit to your project, run:

pnpm

npm

yarn

`_10

pnpm add @safe-global/sdk-starter-kit`

← Go Back[constructor](/reference-sdk-starter-kit/safe-client/constructor "constructor")
