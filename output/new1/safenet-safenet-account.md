# Safenet Account

A Safenet account is a network of [Safe Smart Accounts](/home/what-is-safe) deployed on multiple [chains](/safenet/chains).
A Safe Smart Account is connected to a Safenet account by adding the Safenet [Guard](/safenet/protocol/guard) as a co-signer.

Initially, one Safe Smart Account can be added per chain. In later phases of the roadmap, multiple Safe Smart Accounts can be added per chain.
