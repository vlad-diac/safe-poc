Guard

# Guard

The Guard is a smart contract deployed on every chain in Safenet. It is a classic [Safe Guard](/advanced/smart-account-guards).
It functions as a security mechanism that verifies whether a transaction has been co-signed by the [processor](/safenet/core-components/processor).

The Guard safeguards against fraudulent or unauthorized [transactions](/safenet/safenet-transaction), providing an additional layer of security to the Safenet protocol.
It also ensures that only authorized [processors](/safenet/core-components/processor) can initiate and approve transactions, maintaining the system's integrity.
