# Safe DAO

The Safe DAO is the governing body responsible for the ownership and configuration of the [guarantee engine](/safenet/protocol/guarantee-engine) and other parts of Safenet.
It is the only entity that can modify Safenet's configurations via the guarantee engine.
These configurations are managed on [Ethereum Mainnet](/safenet/chains) and can be updated based on the ecosystem's evolving needs.

The Safe DAO ensures that Safenet operates decentralized and flexible, providing the necessary oversight for secure and efficient cross-chain operations.
