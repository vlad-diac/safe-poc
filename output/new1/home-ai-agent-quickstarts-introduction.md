Introduction

# Quickstarts to set up your AI agent with Safe Smart Account

In these pages you will find quickstart guides to set your AI agent up and running with Safe Smart Accounts.

We describe these different setups:

1. [Basic Agent Setup](/home/ai-agent-quickstarts/basic-agent-setup): The simplest and fastest setup for your agent.
2. [Human Approval for agent actions](/home/ai-agent-quickstarts/human-approval): The AI agent proposes transactions, human signers approve and execute the transaction. Highest security, but not the fastest.
3. [Multi Agent Setup](/home/ai-agent-quickstarts/multi-agent-setup): Multiple Agents are signers of a Smart Account. They have to approve and execute each others transactions.
4. [Agent with a spending limit](/home/ai-agent-quickstarts/agent-with-spending-limit): An AI agent gets a spending limit on your treasury or DAO funds. This advanced setup allows fast transactions with a good amount of security.
