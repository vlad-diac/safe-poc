The Safe React Hooks are the starting point for interacting with the Safe smart account using a React application.

These hooks are built on top of the [Starter Kit](/sdk/starter-kit), which leverages and abstracts the complex logic from several kits from the Safe{Core} SDK, allowing you to set a React context that gives access to the exposed Safe functionality everywhere in your application.
