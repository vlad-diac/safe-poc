# Beneficiary

The Beneficiary refers to the account receiving the debited funds during the [settlement](/safenet/concepts/settlement) process.
In more complex scenarios, the [processor](/safenet/core-components/processor) may collect all debited funds and distribute them to cover processor fees, [liquidity provider](/safenet/core-components/liquidity-provider) reimbursements, and [relayer](/safenet/protocol/relayer) compensation.
