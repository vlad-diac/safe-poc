# Developer tooling for ERC-7579

Rhinestone has developed the following tools to build with ERC-7579:

- [**ModuleKit** (opens in a new tab)](https://docs.rhinestone.wtf/modulekit): This abstraction library for building, testing, and deploying modules
- [**ModuleSDK** (opens in a new tab)](https://docs.rhinestone.wtf/module-sdk): A TypeScript library for using ERC-7579 modules within any application built for modular smart accounts
- [**ModuleStore** (opens in a new tab)](https://blog.rhinestone.wtf/the-module-store-and-whats-under-the-hood-2e703f4339d4): A point of distribution for module developers and module discovery for dapp developers
- [**Module Registry** (opens in a new tab)](https://blog.rhinestone.wtf/a-foundational-layer-to-modular-account-abstraction-e7b21ae56034): This registry ensures the security and compliance of third-party modules, storing on-chain attestations that provide trust and safety for users.
