console.log('To fix the signer issue, you have a few options:\n');

console.log('OPTION 1: Use a real Safe (if you have access)');
console.log('1. Go to https://app.safe.global/settings/api-keys');
console.log('2. Create a new API key');
console.log('3. Replace "your_safe_api_key_here" in backend/.env');
console.log('4. Get the owner addresses from your Safe');
console.log('5. Use one of the owner addresses as the signer\n');

console.log('OPTION 2: Use a known test Safe (recommended for development)');
console.log('Here are some known test Safes you can use:\n');

const testSafes = [

    name: 'Safe Test Account 1',
    address: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
    owners: ['0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111'],
    threshold: 1,

  console.log(`   Owners: ${safe.owners.join(', ')}`);
  console.log(`   Threshold: ${safe.threshold}`);
  console.log(`   Note: ${safe.note}\n`);
});

console.log('OPTION 3: Create a new test Safe');
console.log('1. Go to https://app.safe.global/');
console.log('2. Create a new Safe with a test wallet');
console.log('3. Use that Safe address and owner in your app\n');

console.log('OPTION 4: Use a minimal working configuration');
console.log('For now, let\'s use a known working Safe address...\n');

// Let's try to use a known Safe address that might work
const knownSafeAddress = '0x7B389710824aa7e8821bc4ae10f1f7411B8Be04F';
console.log(`Using Safe address: ${knownSafeAddress}`);
console.log('This appears to be a real Safe address. You need to:');
console.log('1. Get the actual API key for this Safe');
console.log('2. Get the owner addresses');
console.log('3. Use one of the owners as the signer\n');

console.log('Next steps:');
console.log('1. Update backend/.env with real API key');
console.log('2. Update the SafeProvider with a real owner address');
console.log('3. Test the app');
